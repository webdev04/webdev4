          <p>So today you had to finally bid adieu to the teens. It's a little heartbreaking, I know. The twenties might look a bit scary, but trust me, they aren't. New experiences, people, and journeys await you and it would be reallyyy exciting to experience all the new things. Just look back at your journey till now. You would have made some really good friends and maybe some lifelong ones too who would be there whenever you feel a little unsure about moving ahead and exploring new paths. All the wonderful people, your parents, they are always there for you, standing behind you like a wall and they will not let you fall. So let go of your worries and just let the things happen. You'll be alright :)</p>
