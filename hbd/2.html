          <p>I hope that you enjoyed your day really well. The unprecendented times might've put some hindrance in your birthday celebrations but hey, this is life, and it's not perfect. Since the midnight you would've been busy getting b'day wishes from your friends and family. Now as things settle down, I hope that you are content with all the love that you received.</p>
